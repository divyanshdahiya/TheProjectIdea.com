      <h2>1. Third-party API</h2>
      <p>
        Create a site that consumes a third-party API. Almost every company you
        work for is going to consume an API, whether it's a web or library API,
        they are going to consume an API from somewhere and you can integrate
        it. This is a great skill set to have. You do not need to build a
        complex backend since the API you are using takes care of that for you.
